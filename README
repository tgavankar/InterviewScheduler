*** What is it:
This is a tool to be used by job recruiters who are interviewing candidates.
Usually, the recruiter emails all their candidates for their available times,
and the candidates reply, and then the recruiter schedules the interviews
by hand. This is grossly inefficient, especially with schedules that change weekly
and many candidates.

To alleviate this problem, ScheduleMatch takes in the recruiter/interviewer's calendar
for availability as well as the calendars for each candidate and finds
times that work for everyone. It adds the interviews to the recruiters calendar, so 
then the recruiter can go through their calendar and notify the candidates
of their scheduled interview time for confirmation.


*** To Use:
Run this application using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80` so you can access it
via the web browser directly at http://localhost/.

The Google API settings for our API keys are set to these ports so using other
ports may not work.

The calendars must be set to public visibility (under Calendar Settings -> Share 
This Calendar on calendar.google.com). It does not matter if you only show free/busy. 

The interviewer calendar MUST be on the testers account. We advise that you create
a new calendar and put in events (i.e. "weekend" and "sleep") where you are
marked as busy. 

For example, see:

IMPORTANT: ScheduleMatch will modify the interviewer's calendar by adding events
for each interview. For this reason, the interviewer's calendar must be on the same Google
account as the tester (so oauth works correctly).

The candidates' calendars must also be set to public visibility. We have created a sample calendar
for ease:
